TASK
You will receive one or more reference photos of the same person. Fuse them into a single consistent identity and generate EXACTLY ONE final image in the specified retro-futurist poster style.

SUBJECT
STARSHIP CAPTAIN — Calm authority, gaze off-frame. Orange exosuit with chrome collar ring, polished enamel chest plates, mission insignia, subtle illuminated seams. Background: orbital docks with cinematic lighting and a thin rocket trail past a bright moon.

REFERENCE HANDLING
• Treat all provided images as the same person.
• Identity anchor: use the clearest, most front-facing photo as the primary reference.
• Use other angles only to refine details (profile → nose/jaw; three-quarter → cheekbones; from above → hairline; from below → jaw/neck).
• If some views are missing, infer from available references without exaggeration.
• Keep hairstyle and facial hair exactly as in the majority of references (no invention/removal).
• Normalize expression to calm, confident; eyes open, neutral mouth.
• Correct perspective/lens distortions from extreme angles; keep natural proportions.
• Gender and age must match the references.

STYLE
Retro-futurism / atompunk, mid-century sci-fi poster. Heroic, optimistic tone.
Stylized cinematic shading with clean edges and smooth but simplified transitions.
Simplified tonal depth: 6–10 tone bands per color, giving a poster-like aesthetic without flat cartoon style.
Cinematic film influence: strong 3/4 key light, cool rim reflections on chrome, high contrast, gentle bloom on highlights.
Materials: enamel-painted metal, polished chrome, visible screws, rivets, tubes and cabling with stylized reflections.
Palette: warm accents (red, orange, ochre) vs cool tones (teal, turquoise, steel grey, beige), ~70/30 warm–cool balance.
Surface detail: glossy speculars, fine scratches, subtle edge wear; retain stylized realism, not pure vector flatness.

FACE & LIKENESS
• Preserve identity faithfully (face shape, features, skin tone, age range).
• Light youth retouch: smooth fine lines, reduce under-eye shadows, soften nasolabial folds, even skin tone; keep pores/skin texture. Target ≈ 10 years younger.
• Do NOT alter bone structure or feature sizes. Keep distinctive marks (moles/freckles/scars).

GLOBAL RULES
No helmet or headgear. No goggles/visors. Chest-up hero framing, slight low angle (50–85 mm lens feel). No text or logos.

NEGATIVE PROMPT
helmet, headgear, goggles, face occlusion, over-retouched, plastic/waxy skin, blurry, noisy, low-res, muddy gradients, banding beyond 4–6 tone steps, distorted anatomy, extra limbs, watermark, logos, text, heavy vignette, oversaturated orange cast, altered eye/lip size, photographic texture look.

OUTPUT
Produce EXACTLY ONE high-resolution square image (the SUBJECT above), clean edges, consistent likeness with the references.
